# Project Overview:
We need a Python-based web application, PyTasks, that will allow users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application should allow users to create, edit, delete, and track tasks. The solution should be simple yet robust, focusing on functionality, performance, and clean code practices.

# Project Goals
• Build a full-stack web application using Python.
• Provide a user-friendly interface for task management.
• Ensure efficient back-end handling with a secure user authentication system.
• Write clean, maintainable code that adheres to Pythonic principles.

# Project Requirements

Key Features:
1.User Authentication:
o Users must be able to register and log in using an email and password.
o Implement basic session management to track logged-in users.

2. Task Management:
o Create Task: Users should be able to create a task with a title, description, and due date.
o Edit Task: Users should be able to update task details.
o Delete Task: Users should be able to delete tasks.
o Mark as Complete: Users should be able to mark tasks as complete.
o Task Filters: Allow users to filter tasks by status (All, Completed, Pending) and due date.

3. User-Friendly Dashboard:
o Provide a simple and intuitive dashboard that lists all tasks.
o Display notifications (e.g., a message when a task is marked complete).

4. Responsiveness:
o Ensure that the web app works well on mobile and desktop devices.

#Technical Requirements:

Front-end:
o Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the front-end.
o Build the user interface using React.js (or Vue.js or Angular).
o You can use front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize CSS to style the web application.

Back-end:
o Use Python with Flask (or Django) as the web framework.
o Implement a RESTful API for handling task-related operations (create, read, update, delete tasks).
o Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store user data and task information.

User Authentication:
o Implement user authentication with Flask's built-in Flask-Login or Django's authentication system.
o Use Flask-WTF for form validation (or Django forms).

Database:
o Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy for Flask, or Django's ORM) to interact with the database.
o The database should store user profiles and associated tasks.

Security:
o Implement password hashing with Werkzeug (for Flask) or Django’s password hashers.
o Ensure user input is validated to prevent SQL injection and other security risks.

Version Control:
o Use Git for version control.
o Set up a GitHub repository for tracking progress, with meaningful commits and proper branch management.

# Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: optimise page load times by minimizing the number of requests and handling large datasets efficiently.

Scalability: structure the codebase in a modular way, so new features or components can be easily added later.

Accessibility: ensure the app is accessible following WCAG standards (e.g., appropriate contrast, keyboard navigation).

Testing: write unit tests to ensure the integrity of key components, especially around authentication and task management.
         test for responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
         
Target Audience: the app is designed for individuals, freelancers, and small teams who need a simple tool to manage tasks and increase productivity.

# Design Requirements:

Minimalist and Clean Design:
o The interface should be simple and functional, focusing on usability.
o Use a neutral color scheme to keep the design professional and easy to read.

Easy Navigation:
o Ensure that users can easily navigate between task lists, filters, and the task creation/editing forms.

Project Timeline:
•	Phase 1: Project Setup & Design (1 week)
    Set up the project environment, create wireframes and design mockups.

•	Phase 2: Back-End Development (2 weeks)
    Implement user authentication, database models, and RESTful API for task management.

•	Phase 3: Front-End Development (1.5 weeks)
    Build out the front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

•	Phase 4: Testing & Debugging (1 week)
    Test for bugs, validate the user experience, and ensure everything works as expected.

•	Phase 5: Deployment (0.5 week)
    Deploy the app using a service like Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or AWS.

# Deliverables:
•	A fully functioning task management web application deployed online.
•	A GitHub repository with a well-documented README explaining setup instructions and usage.
•	API documentation for future development or third-party integrations.
•	Unit tests and code quality reports.

# Success Criteria
•	Users can sign up, log in, and manage their tasks (CRUD operations) efficiently.
•	The application runs smoothly and is accessible across different device sizes.
•	The code follows Python’s best practices (PEP8) and is structured for scalability.
